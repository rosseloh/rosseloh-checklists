## rosseloh-checklists
#### Custom-built PDF checklists for X-Plane addons, designed to fit nicely on Avitab with minimal fuss.

Initially, this will focus on one type of checklist - the true "checklist", not a full procedures list. This is a list, usually fairly short, of items that you would check are complete at various stages of a flight, after performing your flows to complete said items. In the future this may be expanded to include procedures lists as well.

It will also focus primarily on airplanes that I own and fly, as these are the ones I'm actually interested in having checklists for.

The design ideals at this moment are to create checklist files that are:
* Sized such that they fit on Avitab with no zooming or panning required
* A different page for every checklist, unless two are so closely related that it makes sense to have multiple per page - click the next page button to move on to the next checklist when finished.
* Simple and easy to follow, so long as the user understands the airplane they are flying. These are not full procedures, but *checklists*. They won't tell you where the de-icing panel is and which switches to flip, but merely ask "is the de-icing system set as required?"
* Have as little extraneous information as possible. Exceptions to this might be exemplified by the After Takeoff and Approach checklists including flap schedules or important speeds.
* Be easy to read quickly and visually distinct so a pilot can maintain their place with little mental effort.

The end result should be checklists that can be followed at a glance, with very little heads-down time during high-workload flight segments. The first few times a pilot uses one they may need to spend a little more time figuring out what they're doing, but that's the beauty of the simulator - we can take our time if necessary. Once the pilot is familiar with the aircraft, these checklists should be sufficient to ensure safe operation in as short of a time as possible.

## File organization

Each aircraft will have its own sub-directory, with two primary files per folder - a text file with the basic checklist items, and the actual PDF file which is sized appropriately to work with Avitab out of the box.

If you have a suggestion for new or modified items for the checklists, the text file is where to put those (or raise an issue, if that's your thing).
