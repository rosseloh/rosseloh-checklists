PDF Checklists for X-Plane addons

These checklists are designed to be printed on 8.5" x 11" "US Letter" size paper, in portrait orientation, double sided flipped on the long edge; then cut out down the long axis (4.25" at the cut), and laminated. This provides a 4.25"x11" (plus lamination edges) card which for me, is a good fit for simulator checklists.
